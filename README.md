# test_cicd

The 'test_cicd_01' project was generated by using the default-python template.

## Getting started

1. Install the Databricks CLI from https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html

2. Authenticate to your Databricks workspace, if you have not done so already:
    ```
    $ databricks configure
    ```

3. To deploy a development copy of this project, type:
    ```
    $ databricks bundle deploy --target dev
    ```
    (Note that "dev" is the default target, so the `--target` parameter
    is optional here.)

    This deploys everything that's defined for this project.
    For example, the default template would deploy a job called
    `[dev yourname] test_cicd_01_01_job` to your workspace.
    You can find that job by opening your workpace and clicking on **Workflows**.

4. To run a job or pipeline, use the "run" command:
   ```
   $ databricks bundle run
   ```

5. Optionally, install developer tools such as the Databricks extension for Visual Studio Code from
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/vscode-ext.html. Or read the "getting started" documentation for
   **Databricks Connect** for instructions on running the included Python code from a different IDE.

6. For documentation on the Databricks asset bundles format used
   for this project, and for CI/CD configuration, see
   https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/bundles/index.html.

7. Import modules in the DAB:
- `root` variable in `src/set_notebook_paths.ipynb` is the bundle name.
- `_bundle_name` variable in `src/module/path_manager.py::PathResolver` is the bundle name.
- Util for path processing: See [src/module/path_manager.py](https://github.com/hurcy/test_cicd_01/blob/main/src/module/path_manager.py).
- Example: See [src/main.ipynb](https://github.com/hurcy/test_cicd_01/blob/main/src/main.ipynb).
